# Script 
#### "histone_analyzer.py" contains the python code to analyze the data
#### To run the Repetitive Gene Selection Tool (RGS):
- ```./run_rgs_analysis.sh```

##### To view results:
- ```cd ../output```
- ```less NS_results.txt```

##### If debugging is necessary for any reason, an "under-the-hood" debugger file is saved in the output directory after every RGS run. Only the most recent version is saved in the file debugger_file.txt so the following command can only be ran **after** running the Repetitve Gene Selection Tool.

- ```less debugger_file.txt```
