N_S <- read_tsv("NS_results.txt", col_types = "cfcddd")
```
### Creating Figure 1
```
N_S %>% ggplot(aes(x = Histone, y = N_S, color = Ploidy)) + geom_boxplot()+ theme_classic() + scale_color_manual(values = c("red","blue","orange"))  
```
### Statistical Test
To test if there was a signifcant difference in N/S distribution between the three ploidies of each histone gene in Figure 1, A Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was performed for each histone gene. A test was also perfomred for the over all distribution between the three ploidies (graph not created). 
```
NS<- select(N_S, "Ploidy", "Histone", "N_S")
# Test on H2A
H2A <- filter(NS, Histone == "H2A")
kruskal.test(N_S ~ Ploidy, data = H2A)

Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test

data:  N_S by Ploidy
Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 3.1215, df = 2, p-value = 0.21

# Test on H2B
H2B <- filter(NS, Histone == "H2B")
kruskal.test(N_S ~ Ploidy, data = H2B)

Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test

data:  N_S by Ploidy
Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 6.7804, df = 2, p-value = 0.0337

# Test on H3
H3 <- filter(NS, Histone == "H3")
kruskal.test(N_S ~ Ploidy, data = H3)

Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test

data:  N_S by Ploidy
Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 2.9449, df = 2, p-value = 0.2294

# Test on H4
H4 <- filter(NS, Histone == "H4")
kruskal.test(N_S ~ Ploidy, data = H4)

Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test

data:  N_S by Ploidy
Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 3.5688, df = 2, p-value = 0.1679

# Test on all Histone genes between ploidies 
kruskal.test(N_S ~ Ploidy, data = NS)

Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test

data:  N_S by Ploidy
Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 12.624, df = 2, p-value = 0.001814
``` 
### Creating Figure 2
The second graph compares sexual vs asexaul reproduction (instead of Ploidy)
```
n_s <- read_tsv("NS_results.txt", col_types = "cicddd")
n_s <- n_s %>% mutate(
  Mode = factor(Ploidy, levels = c(2,3,4), 
                labels = c("sex","asex","asex")))
n_s %>% ggplot(aes(x = Histone, y = N_S, color = Mode)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic() + scale_color_manual(values = c("blue","red"))
```
### Stastical test 
only a statical test was ran on N/S results comparing asex and sex values from Figure 2. 
Numerical lists of N/S values from sexual and asexaul snails had to be created
Wilcox rank sum test was ran with Sex and Asex Dn/Ds values
```
asex<- filter(n_s, Mode == "asex")
view(asex)
sex <- filter(n_s,Mode == "sex")
view(sex)
x <- select(sex,N_S)
view (x)
y <- select (asex,N_S)
view (y)
x <-c(x)
y <-c(y)
View(x)
View(y)
X <-as.numeric(x[[1]])
view(X)
Y<-as.numeric(y[[1]])
view(Y)
# Test that X<Y
wilcox.test(X,Y,alternative = "less")

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  X and Y
W = 974, p-value = 0.003359
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is less than 0
# Test that X does not equal Y
wilcox.test(X,Y,alternative = "two.sided")

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  X and Y
W = 974, p-value = 0.006718
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
# Test that X>Y
wilcox.test(X,Y,alternative = "greater")

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  X and Y
W = 974, p-value = 0.9967
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is greater than 0
 ```
To test the sex and asex values for each individual histone genes,
filtering and numerical lists had to be created.
Then a Wilcox rank sum test was performed for each histone gene, only testing for X < Y. 
```
# Test H2A that sex < asex 
Ah2a <- filter (asex, Histone =="H2A")
A.2a <- select( Ah2a, N_S)
A_2a <- as.numeric(A.2a[[1]])
Sh2a <- filter (sex, Histone =="H2A")
S.2a <- select( Sh2a, N_S)
S_2a <- as.numeric(S.2a[[1]])
wilcox.test(S_2a,A_2a,alternative = "less")

	Wilcoxon rank sum test

data:  S_2a and A_2a
W = 62, p-value = 0.1061
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is less than 0

# Test H2B that sex < asex 
Ah2b <- filter (asex, Histone =="H2B")
A.2b <- select( Ah2b, N_S)
A_2b <- as.numeric(A.2b[[1]])
Sh2b <- filter (sex, Histone =="H2B")
S.2b <- select( Sh2b, N_S)
S_2b <- as.numeric(S.2b[[1]])
wilcox.test(S_2b,A_2b,alternative = "less")

	Wilcoxon rank sum test

data:  S_2b and A_2b
W = 49, p-value = 0.02824
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is less than 0

# Test H3 that sex < asex 
Ah3 <- filter (asex, Histone =="H3")
A.3 <- select( Ah3, N_S)
A_3 <- as.numeric(A.3[[1]])
Sh3 <- filter (sex, Histone =="H3")
S.3 <- select( Sh3, N_S)
S_3 <- as.numeric(S.3[[1]])
wilcox.test(S_3,A_3,alternative = "less")

	Wilcoxon rank sum test

data:  S_3 and A_3
W = 59, p-value = 0.08113
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is less than 0

# Test h4 that sex < asex 
Ah4 <- filter (asex, Histone =="H4")
A.4 <- select( Ah4, N_S)
A_4 <- as.numeric(A.4[[1]])
Sh4 <- filter (sex, Histone =="H4")
S.4 <- select( Sh4, N_S)
S_4 <- as.numeric(S.4[[1]])
wilcox.test(S_4,A_4,alternative = "less")

	Wilcoxon rank sum test

data:  S_4 and A_4
W = 57, p-value = 0.06704
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is less than 0
```
### Creating Figure 3 and 4
The N/S values for all four histone genes were displayed per lineage. The first graph displays the ploidy per lineage, the second graph displays which histone gene is represent by each dot
```
N_S %>% ggplot(aes(x = Lineage, y = N_S, color = Ploidy)) + geom_point()+ theme_classic() + scale_color_manual(values = c("red","blue","orange")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 8))
N_S %>% ggplot(aes(x = Lineage, y = N_S, color = Histone)) + geom_point()+ theme_classic() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 8))
```
